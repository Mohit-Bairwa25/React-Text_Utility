Here You Can Write Your actual Code

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      Wite Code Here
    </>
  );
}

These are JSX Rules

Alwayas Use / in closing Tag like this
<h1><h1/> or <></> in above case

className is used insted of class

htmlFor is used insted of class htmlfor

herf='/' is used insted of herf='#'

tabIndex is used insted of tabindex

a samll error can mess your whole website

in VS Code Settings Write "emmet"

look for Emmet:Include Language
Enter
Key=javascript & Value=javascriptreact

In JSX (JavaScript XML), you can add comments using curly braces {}. Here are two ways to do it:

Single-line comment: To comment a single line, use the following syntax:
{/* This is a single-line comment */}

Multi-line comment: For multi-line comments, wrap them in curly braces and use the /* */ syntax:
<div className="dropdown">
  {/* whenClicked is a property, not an event */}
  <Button whenClicked={this.handleClick} className="btn-default" title={this.props.title} subTitleClassName="caret"></Button>
  <UnorderedList />
</div>

you can write css in App.css

Use scrit mode
<script>"use strict";<script/>

It imposeses restrictions & Helps you write a clean Code

like 

d=30; in normal mode it will run
but in strict mode it will throw error
 you have to write 
 let d=90;
